# Monday-Coffee-Expansion-SQL-Project
This project analyzes Monday Coffee’s sales data across cities using SQL, Python, and Power BI to identify the best location for expansion. It covers data cleaning, modeling, visualization, and insight generationb delivering data-driven recommendations for business growth.


Objective:
The main goal of this project was to analyze sales and customer data from multiple cities to determine where Monday Coffee should open its next outlet. The project focuses on understanding revenue patterns, product popularity, customer engagement, and overall market performance across different regions.

Tools and Technologies Used:

* SQL for data extraction and cleaning
* Python for data processing and modeling
* Power BI for visualization and dashboard creation

Process and Steps Followed:

1. Data Collection and Preparation:
   All raw data from Monday Coffee’s branches across different cities were imported into SQL for cleaning and preparation. The dataset included sales transactions, customer demographics, product categories, and order frequency. Null values and duplicates were handled, and key metrics such as total revenue, average order value, and product-wise sales were calculated.

2. Data Modeling:
   Relationships were established between tables such as Orders, Customers, and Products. The data model was optimized to ensure accurate aggregation of values when visualized in Power BI.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   The initial analysis involved finding trends such as:

* Which cities generate the highest total revenue
* Which products contribute most to the profit margin
* Which customer segment shows the highest repeat purchase rate
* Monthly and yearly growth patterns

The findings revealed interesting differences between cities — for example, some cities showed high sales volume but low average spending, while others had fewer orders but higher profitability per customer.

4. Visualization and Dashboard Creation (Power BI):
   Interactive dashboards were created in Power BI to visualize all major KPIs. The key visuals included:

* City-wise Sales Performance (bar chart)
* Product Category Contribution (pie or donut chart)
* Revenue Trend Over Time (line chart)
* Top 10 Performing Products (horizontal bar chart)
* Customer Retention and Loyalty Indicators

The Power BI report allowed users to slice and filter data by city, product type, and time period, giving management an easy way to explore various performance dimensions.

5. Analysis of Findings:
   Through the analysis, the following insights were discovered:

* City A (for example, New York or whichever city the data suggested) had the highest total revenue and consistent month-over-month growth.
* City B had a large number of customers but lower revenue per order, indicating potential for improvement through upselling or premium product introduction.
* City C showed a fast-rising trend, suggesting strong emerging potential for expansion.
* Seasonal patterns were observed, with noticeable sales spikes during weekends and festive months.

6. Decision and Recommendation:
   Based on all metrics — total sales, growth rate, average order value, and customer retention — the analysis recommended expanding Monday Coffee’s next outlet in the city showing both strong profitability and steady customer growth. The insights supported data-backed decision-making for management rather than relying on assumptions.

7. Key Learning Outcomes:
   This project helped strengthen the understanding of:

* How to design a complete analytics workflow from raw data to final business recommendation
* Real-world SQL query optimization and Power BI dashboard development
* Translating data patterns into actionable business insights
* Building a professional, portfolio-ready project combining Python, SQL, and visualization tools

Conclusion:
The Monday Coffee Expansion Analysis successfully simulated a real-world business case where an organization uses data analytics to drive its growth strategy. By analyzing customer behavior, product performance, and city-level profitability, the project provided a clear, evidence-based recommendation for expansion.



Would you like me to make it a bit more **personalized** (for example, “In this project, I analyzed…” instead of “The project analyzed…”)?
That version reads better in resumes or LinkedIn descriptions.
